This project aims to teach learners how to responsibly gather information from websites using web scraping techniques and then analyze it using exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques. 
By doing so, they will gain the ability to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that may be hidden within the data. 
This process emphasizes ethical data extraction and a thorough exploration of the gathered information.
